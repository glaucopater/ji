## Components

### Scene
- 3D environment setup with proper lighting and camera controls
- Manages the humanoid model and animation state
- Position saving and loading system
- Default position reset functionality
- Screenshot capture system with automatic file naming
- Camera rotation controls with preset angles

### Humanoid
- Fully articulated 3D model with:
  - Head and body
  - Articulated arms (upper/lower) with hands
  - Articulated legs (upper/lower) with feet
  - Yellow joint indicators for better visualization
- Real-time position updates
- Smooth transitions between positions

### Animation System
- Keyframe-based animation system
- Support for:
  - Single-play techniques
  - Looping animations (like walking)
  - Toggle-based animations
  - Default stopped state
  - Position-based animations
- Smooth interpolation between keyframes
- Error recovery and state management

### Technique Editor
- Visual flow-based programming interface
- Node-based movement creation
- Real-time technique preview
- Save and load technique configurations
- Export/import technique definitions
- Last updated timestamps for techniques
- Technique categorization and filtering
- Automatic state persistence

### Position Management
- Save current model positions
- Load saved positions
- Export positions as JSON
- Position cards with timestamps
- Default position reset
- Smooth transitions between positions
- Screenshot preview in position cards

### UI Components
- Technique cards showing:
  - Name in English
  - Japanese name
  - Category
  - Difficulty level
  - Last updated timestamp
- Position cards with:
  - Position name
  - Timestamp
  - Preview indicator
- Export/import buttons for data management
- Screenshot capture button
- Camera control buttons

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `1`: First technique
- `2`: Second technique

### Mouse/Touch
- Click technique cards to execute techniques
- Toggle walking animation ON/OFF
- Use OrbitControls to rotate and zoom the view
- Click position cards to load saved positions
- Click export button to save positions/techniques
- Click screenshot button to capture current view

### Camera Controls
- Rotate X/Y/Z axis by 45Â° increments
- Reset camera to default position
- Zoom in/out with scroll wheel
- Orbit with left mouse button
- Pan with right mouse button

### Position Management
- Save positions with screenshots
- Export all positions as JSON
- Import positions from JSON files
- Reset to default position
- Quick position switching

### Technique Editor
- Create new techniques
- Add movement nodes
- Connect nodes to create sequences
- Edit node parameters
- Save and load techniques
- Export techniques as JSON
- Delete unwanted techniques

## Technical Implementation

### Key Technologies
- React
- TypeScript
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- React Three Drei
- React Flow (for technique editor)

### Animation Architecture
- Uses React's `useFrame` for animation updates
- Implements keyframe interpolation
- Handles animation state management
- Provides error recovery mechanisms
- Smooth transitions between states

## Development

```bash
# Run linter
yarn lint

# Type checking
yarn tsc
```

## Testing
The project uses Jest and React Testing Library for testing. Tests are located next to their corresponding components with the `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
yarn test:coverage
```

## Future Enhancements
Potential areas for future development:
- Additional judo techniques
- More complex animations
- Physics-based interactions
- Performance optimizations
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Advanced technique editor features
- Enhanced position management
- Multi-model interactions
