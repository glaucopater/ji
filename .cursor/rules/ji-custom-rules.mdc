Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Avoid loops, when you propose a solution check if this was not already propososed. If was already done, inform me about this and find a different strategy
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes if possible
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid files longer than 150-200 lines of code.
- When I tell you that the feature is working fine, than: document it in the readme.md, add unit tests
- If I tell you "loop" or "rabbit hole" it means that you are not doing any progress, change strategy
  

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
- Use declarative JSX/TSX.
- Avoid double ternary expression.
