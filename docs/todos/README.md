# TODO Files

This folder contains timestamped TODO files that track changes and features over time.

## File Naming Convention

Files are named using the format: `todo_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.md`

Example: `todo_2026-01-11_18-58-55.md`

## Purpose

1. **Track Changes**: Each TODO file captures the state of tasks and features at a specific point in time
2. **PR Descriptions**: These files serve as a guideline for creating Pull Request descriptions
3. **Change History**: Maintain a chronological record of development progress

## Usage

When creating a new TODO file:
1. Copy the latest TODO file as a template
2. Update the timestamp in the filename
3. Add new tasks or mark completed ones with ✅
4. Include any new features or changes

## Generating PR Descriptions

Use the `generate-pr-description.js` script to automatically generate PR descriptions from TODO files.
